3. **Inconsistent Name Formatting**:
   - **Solution:** Applied SQL string functions to split names into first and last names, handling variations like middle initials.
4. **File Access Errors**:
   - **Solution:** Converted CSV files to SQL using an online tool, allowing for direct import into MySQL.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors that drive movie profitability and market success.
